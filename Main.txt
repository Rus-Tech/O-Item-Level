Changing enchants requires updating local oenchantItem to have a 1 for each slot that can be enchanted and updating local enchantID
to have the correct ID for the best enchants. On wowhead under the enchant it should have an effect ID ex https://www.wowhead.com/spell=323762/sacred-stats

Changing gems requires update local gemTexture with the texture ID of the best gems. Looking up gem on wowhead and hovering over icon name will have the texture ID in the link

Individual boss kill stats can be found with wowhead statistics and then filter by boss name.
Example - https://www.wowhead.com/battle-for-azeroth-dungeon-and-raid-statistics/name:taloc

finding the instanceID of a new raid from anywhere

/run for i=1177,1200,1 do name = EJ_GetInstanceInfo(i) print(i,name) end
